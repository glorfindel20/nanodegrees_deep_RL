# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Algorithm
In order to solve this challenge, I have explored and implemented the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG), as described in this paper: [Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971).

### Development


### Fine-tuning the hyperparameters


## Result
