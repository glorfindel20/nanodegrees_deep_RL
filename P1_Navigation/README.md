# Train an RL Agent to Collect Bananas

# Goal
In this project, I build a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that navigates an environment that is similar to Unity's Banana Collector environment.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. The goal of our agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas. In order to solve the environment, our agent must achieve an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

# Getting Started
Download the environment from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

Linux: click here
Mac OSX: click here
Windows (32-bit): click here
Windows (64-bit): click here
(For Windows users) Check out this link if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

(For AWS) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not enabled a virtual screen), then please use this link to obtain the environment.


Instructions
Follow the instructions in Navigation.ipynb to get started with training your own agent!
